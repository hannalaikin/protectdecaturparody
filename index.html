      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What can I do</h2>

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
        A guide for the very concerned resident who prefers emotion over evidence.
      </p>

      <ol class="space-y-4 text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
        <li>
          <strong>1. Attend every public meeting and ignore facts.</strong><br>
          Bring pre printed talking points. Do not read staff reports. Do not listen. Interrupt politely at first then loudly.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2. Demand community input then reject every outcome.</strong><br>
          Join the process until the result feels wrong. Then claim the process was unfair from the start.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>3. Chant slogans instead of asking questions.</strong><br>
          Zoning utilities and environmental controls are complex. A loud chant is simpler.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>4. Coordinate applause boos and synchronized outrage.</strong><br>
          Clap in the middle of answers. Cheer when someone repeats a rumor. Boo when someone reads from the staff report.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>5. Hold hands for dramatic effect.</strong><br>
          This does not change the vote. It photographs well in a group text and on social feeds.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>6. Recruit friends from outside the community.</strong><br>
          A local issue is no barrier. Bring people who have never been here and feel extremely sure of their opinion.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>7. Call disagreement hate.</strong><br>
          If someone supports the project do not debate. Assign a motive and move on.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>8. Repeat claims after they are corrected.</strong><br>
          If a claim is simple and viral that matters more than accuracy. Share it again.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>9. Accuse experts of lying then demand new expert studies.</strong><br>
          Dismiss the first study. Ask for another study. Announce in advance that you do not trust the second study either.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>10. Shout follow the money.</strong><br>
          No need to say whose money or where it goes. A vague gesture toward the ceiling is enough.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>11. Attend public meetings but promise yourself you will not ask questions.</strong><br>
          Listening might change your mind. It is safer to arrive upset and leave early.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>12. Bring flyers that contradict each other.</strong><br>
          One flyer says the project is too big. Another flyer says no one will ever use it. Hand out both.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- WHY ARE RESIDENTS FIGHTING BACK -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why are residents fighting back</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Because progress is inconvenient.
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-slate-800">

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Higher electricity and water bills maybe one day</h3>
          <p>
            Many people prefer an older grid that feels familiar. Modern infrastructure might remove the surprise of outages and last minute repairs that everyone talks about.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Property values might rise and that feels scary</h3>
          <p>
            Rising property values could grow equity attract reinvestment and support better public services.
            Decline is familiar. Growth is new. New is hard.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Health risks that are theoretical and selective</h3>
          <p>
            Backup generators run for short periods with strict rules. It is more exciting to imagine a permanent cloud that hangs over the township.
            Highways warehouses and trucks feel normal so the concern moves to the new thing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Noise concerns</h3>
          <p>
            Quiet sealed buildings with limited trips somehow feel wrong.
            Constant truck traffic backup beeping and overnight loading docks feel like real industry.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Light at night</h3>
          <p>
            Security lighting that meets code and turns off when not needed feels suspicious.
            Dim broken lights and dark corners feel authentic and do not require change.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Additional concerns that might be raised</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>Concern about too many engineers per person.</li>
            <li>Concern that town hall behavior might become very polite.</li>
            <li>Concern that children might learn how the power grid works.</li>
            <li>Concern that someone says data center instead of warehouse and that ruins the mood.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pt-6 border-t mt-6 text-slate-800 space-y-3">
        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Our real concern if we are honest</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>More jobs feel too steady and too stable.</li>
            <li>More tax revenue is unsettling because it might help schools police and fire.</li>
            <li>Better infrastructure feels suspicious because it looks like planning.</li>
            <li>Preparing for an AI driven economy sounds difficult and new.</li>
            <li>Anything new especially if it works feels like too much change at once.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">In summary</h3>
          <p>
            We are not against data centers in theory.
            We are in favor of decline of the status quo and of complaint.
            We will resist progress quietly loudly and most of all online.
