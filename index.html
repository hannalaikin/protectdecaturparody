        Protecting Our Community Against 900,000 sq. ft. AI Data Center

      </ul>

      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>
        Sabey Corporation, a data center company, is aiming to build a 900,000 sq. ft., 250 Megawatt data center campus.
      </p>

      <h2>Where?</h2>
      <p>
        Between Kentucky Avenue and Camby Road (image from Sabey website).
      </p>
      <p class="small-text">
        Site map and rendering can be placed here from the Sabey website, similar to the original page.
      </p>

      <h2>Why are residents fighting back?</h2>
      <p>
        Because progress is inconvenient.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Higher electricity and water bills, maybe someday</strong><br>
        We prefer an aging grid held together with duct tape. Modern infrastructure threatens the comfort of rolling blackouts, surprise outages, and infrastructure failures we have grown used to.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Property values might go up, and that is a problem</strong><br>
        Rising property values could:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increase equity</li>
        <li>Attract reinvestment</li>
        <li>Improve public services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Naturally, we oppose all of that. Decline is predictable. Growth is scary.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Health risks, selectively framed</strong><br>
        Although backup generators run rarely and under strict regulations, we prefer to imagine them operating all day in a permanent cloud of doom. Actual nearby highways, warehouses, delivery trucks, and existing industrial uses are familiar and therefore harmless.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Noise concerns</strong><br>
        Quiet, enclosed buildings with limited traffic are unacceptable. We strongly favor constant diesel truck traffic, backup beeping, and overnight loading docks. Those noises feel more authentic.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Light pollution</strong><br>
        Security lighting that meets code and shuts down when not needed is deeply offensive. We prefer the warm glow of underfunded streetlights, broken fixtures, and dark corridors that discourage walking and safety.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Our real concern, just being honest</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We oppose high paying jobs.</li>
        <li>We oppose lower traffic than warehouses.</li>
        <li>We oppose new tax revenue for schools, police, and fire.</li>
        <li>We oppose planning for the AI driven economy.</li>
        <li>We oppose anything new, especially if it works.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>In summary</strong><br>
        We are not anti data center. We are pro decline, pro status quo, and pro complaint. And we will fight progress quietly, loudly, and on the internet.
      </p>

      <h2>What can I do?</h2>

      <p>
        Below is a practical guide for the citizen who wants to be very involved, very loud, and not especially informed.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Attend every public meeting, prepared to ignore facts.</strong><br>
          Bring pre printed talking points. Do not read staff reports. Do not listen. Interrupt politely at first, then loudly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Demand community input, then reject all outcomes.</strong><br>
          Participate enthusiastically unless the decision does not go your way. In that case, claim the process was rigged.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chant slogans instead of asking questions.</strong><br>
          Complex topics like zoning, utilities, or environmental controls are best addressed with yelling.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coordinate applause, boos, and synchronized outrage.</strong><br>
          Bonus points if you clap mid sentence while someone else is speaking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hold hands dramatically.</strong><br>
          It does not change the vote, but it photographs well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recruit friends from outside the community.</strong><br>
          Local issue. No problem. Bring reinforcements who have never been here but feel very strongly anyway.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Label disagreement as hate.</strong><br>
          If someone supports the project, do not debate them. Assign a motive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Repeat claims even after they have been corrected.</strong><br>
          Consistency matters more than accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuse experts of lying, then demand expert studies.</strong><br>
          Disregard the studies once they arrive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>If all else fails, shout follow the money.</strong><br>
          No need to specify whose or how. Just gesture vaguely.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="note-box">
        <strong>Important note</strong><br>
        Actual civic engagement usually works better with listening, facts, and good faith discussion. It just is not nearly as theatrical.
        <br><br>
        <span class="small-text">
          Optional taglines:<br>
          Participation without comprehension.<br>
          All emotion. No spreadsheets.<br>
          If we are loud enough, maybe reality will change.<br>
          Democracy, but only if we win.
        </span>
      </div>

      <div class="action-list">
        <h3>1. Donate to the cause</h3>
        <p>
          Help fund more clipboards, matching T shirts, and outrage graphics. All donations go toward vibes, slogans, and printing the same flyer again.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Request a yard sign</h3>
        <p>
          Let your neighbors know where you stand without needing to explain why.
        </p>
        <p>
          Signs available in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>NO, do not ask me for details</li>
          <li>SAVE OUR COMMUNITY</li>
          <li>I READ THE HEADLINE</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Email the city planner, parody</h3>
        <p>
          Email the City Planner. We have drafted a template so you do not have to understand the project. Just copy, paste, and send, no reading required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sample preview line: I am deeply concerned and demand action immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concern subject to change based on Facebook comments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternate line: Bonus points for copying people who are not involved.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Sign the petition</h3>
        <p>
          Sign the Petition. Join thousands of people who agree something feels wrong, even if we cannot say what. Facts optional. Signature permanent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Signing does not require residency.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Calendar of meetings, parody</h3>
        <p>
          Upcoming Meetings and Opportunities to Be Outraged.
        </p>

        <div class="meeting-block">
          <strong>Public Hearing</strong><br>
          Arrive early. Leave before answers are given. Be as disruptive and loud and unfriendly as possible. Shout down the presenters. Try to get removed for television.
        </div>

        <div class="meeting-block">
          <strong>Community Forum</strong><br>
          Ask questions already answered online.
        </div>

        <div class="meeting-block">
          <strong>Vote Night</strong><br>
          Claim the process was unfair regardless of outcome.
        </div>

        <p>
          Attendance encouraged. Listening discouraged.
        </p>
      </div>
