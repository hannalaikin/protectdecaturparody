        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-800">
          Sabey Corporation is a data center company planning a campus of about nine hundred thousand square feet with power service of two hundred fifty megawatts. The numbers are large and repeat well in conversation which makes them very useful in public debate.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Where</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-800">
          The project site sits between Kentucky Avenue and Camby Road in Decatur Township. For many residents this area has been an open canvas for imagined projects which makes any specific proposal feel surprising no matter what it is.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why are residents fighting back</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-800">
          Because progress is inconvenient.
        </p>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-800 text-sm leading-relaxed">

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Bills may rise one day</h3>
            <p>
              It is predicted that electricity and water bills will rise. Predicted by whom depends on which story you hear. The idea that every future bill increase can be pinned on one project is simple and simple stories travel faster than rate case documents.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Property value worries</h3>
            <p>
              Some reports warn about property value loss while others quietly note that new infrastructure can support growth and stability. In discussion the version that produces the strongest feeling usually wins the night.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Health and generator headlines</h3>
            <p>
              Backup generators are described with lists of chemical names plus the word etc. The most alarming part is often the etc because it can hold whatever a reader already fears. In reality these units are limited by permits and test schedules. That detail rarely fits on a yard sign.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Noise in decibels</h3>
            <p>
              Sixty five decibels is about the sound of a car passing by on a street yet it becomes a central figure in many stories. Concerns focus on fans and equipment but are quieter about traffic that already exists.

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Light and sleep</h3>
            <p>
              Any new lighting can be framed as a threat to sleep even when designs use full cutoff fixtures timers and controls. Existing sources such as parking lots billboards and vehicle headlights are often treated as natural features of the landscape.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What can I do</h2>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-700">
          A practical guide for being very involved very loud and not especially informed.
        </p>

        <ol class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">

          <li>
            <strong>Attend every public meeting and ignore facts.</strong><br>
            Bring printed talking points. Do not read staff reports. Do not listen. Interrupt politely at first then raise the volume until everyone is sure you are concerned.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Demand community input then reject every outcome.</strong><br>
            Participate with enthusiasm. If the decision does not match your preference announce that the process was broken from the beginning.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Chant slogans in place of questions.</strong><br>
            Zoning and grid planning are hard. A short chant is easy. The shorter the phrase the more expert it sounds.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Coordinate applause boos and shared outrage.</strong><br>
            Clap when someone repeats a rumor you like. Boo when someone quotes a technical study. Treat volume as evidence.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Use dramatic gestures.</strong><br>
            Holding hands and standing in silence does not change the vote but looks powerful in photos and in group chats.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Recruit friends who do not live here.</strong><br>
            Invite people from outside the township who heard a summary from someone they trust. Local details are optional. Strong opinions are not.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Call disagreement hate.</strong><br>
            If someone supports the project do not ask why. Assume the worst possible motive and move forward with confidence.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Repeat the same claim after it is corrected.</strong><br>
            If a statement is clear and alarming that matters more than whether it survived fact checking. Say it again so it feels established.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Accuse experts of lying then request more expert studies.</strong><br>
            Dismiss the first report as biased. Ask for another one. Explain in advance that you already know how it will be slanted.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Shout follow the money.</strong><br>
            No need to specify which money or whose. A pointed finger and a serious tone are usually enough.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="bg-slate-100 border border-slate-200 rounded-md px-4 py-3 mt-3 text-xs text-slate-700 space-y-1">
          <p>
            Real civic engagement usually works better with reading staff reports listening to answers and asking follow up questions. That approach produces fewer viral clips which is one reason it is used less often.
          </p>
          <p>
            Common themes include participation without comprehension all emotion and no spreadsheets and the hope that enough volume will move reality.

      <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
      <section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">About the project</h2>

        <p class="text-slate-800 text-sm">
          The real site spends many paragraphs describing the project in strong language. Below is a calmer version that keeps the structure while translating some of the favorite phrases.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">What is a data center</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          A data center is a secure building filled with servers that run digital services. They rarely have windows and they rarely invite tours so they are often described as giant windowless warehouses to make them sound more mysterious.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-slate-50 border border-slate-200 rounded-md px-4 py-3 text-xs text-slate-800 space-y-1 mt-2">
          <p><strong>They say</strong> data centers are some of the most energy intensive facilities in the world.</p>
          <p><strong>Translation</strong> the power usage is easy to measure and therefore easier to talk about than many other things that use power quietly and constantly in the background.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-5">Bills and the word skyrocket</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          The phrase skyrocket appears often. It suggests a single project will override every other factor that shapes bills such as fuel costs aging lines storms and statewide policy. It is dramatic and does not require a chart.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-slate-50 border border-slate-200 rounded-md px-4 py-3 text-xs text-slate-800 space-y-1 mt-2">
          <p><strong>They say</strong> it will cost billions and will lead to sky rocketing bills for everyone.</p>
          <p><strong>Translation</strong> we are combining every future grid investment into one number then placing that number at the gate of a single project.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-5">Water and very large ranges</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          A common line is that a single AI data center can use between one and five million gallons of water per day. That range stretches from small town to medium city so it covers almost any picture a reader already has in mind.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-slate-50 border border-slate-200 rounded-md px-4 py-3 text-xs text-slate-800 space-y-1 mt-2">
          <p><strong>They say</strong> water use could match a town of tens of thousands of people.</p>
          <p><strong>Translation</strong> we are not distinguishing between designs that re use water in loops designs that use air cooling and designs that match the headline we like best.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-5">Noise and decibel charts</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          Noise concerns focus on numbers like sixty five decibels into the night. The comparison that this is about as loud as a passing car is usually mentioned quietly if at all.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-slate-50 border border-slate-200 rounded-md px-4 py-3 text-xs text-slate-800 space-y-1 mt-2">
          <p><strong>They say</strong> that at sixty five decibels people begin to face serious risk.</p>
          <p><strong>Translation</strong> we are treating a widely used everyday noise level as an emergency because it suits the story.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-5">Jobs and expectations</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          Much of the argument compares estimated data center jobs to a historic research park plan that was never built. It is easier to argue with a diagram from the past than with the possibility of an empty field.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800 mt-3">
          The same pattern appears in discussions of AI. Some say AI is a bubble and others see it as a major platform shift. Either way the local question is less about global hype and more about what kind of buildings will occupy the land.
