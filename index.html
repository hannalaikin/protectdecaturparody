        A guide for the very concerned resident who prefers emotion over evidence.
      </p>

      <ol class="space-y-4 text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">
        <li>
          <strong>1. Attend every public meeting, prepared to ignore facts.</strong><br>
          Bring pre printed talking points. Do not read staff reports. Do not listen. Interrupt politely at first, then loudly.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2. Demand community input, then reject all outcomes.</strong><br>
          Participate enthusiastically unless the decision does not go your way. In that case, claim the process was rigged.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>3. Chant slogans instead of asking questions.</strong><br>
          Complex topics like zoning, utilities, or environmental controls are best handled with chanting and applause.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>4. Coordinate applause, boos, and synchronized outrage.</strong><br>
          Bonus points if you clap in the middle of someone else speaking so that no one can hear the answer.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>5. Hold hands dramatically.</strong><br>
          It does not change the vote, although it looks powerful in photos and on neighborhood Facebook groups.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>6. Recruit friends from outside the community.</strong><br>
          Local issue. No problem. Bring reinforcements who have never been here but feel very strongly anyway.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>7. Label disagreement as hate.</strong><br>
          If someone supports the project, do not debate them. Assign a motive and move on.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>8. Repeat claims even after they have been corrected.</strong><br>
          Consistency matters more than accuracy. If it was shared once, share it again.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>9. Accuse experts of lying, then demand expert studies.</strong><br>
          Disregard the studies once they arrive. Ask for a new study that will be ignored in advance.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>10. If all else fails, shout follow the money.</strong><br>
          No need to specify whose or how. A vague gesture usually does the work.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>11. Attend public meetings, but only if you do not ask questions.</strong><br>
          Listening might accidentally change your mind. Better to arrive outraged and leave early.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>12. Bring flyers that contradict each other.</strong><br>
          Hand out one that says the project is too big and another that says no one will ever use it.
        </li>
      </ol>

    <!-- WHY ARE RESIDENTS FIGHTING BACK -->
    <section class="space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why are residents fighting back</h2>

      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Because progress is inconvenient.
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-6 text-slate-800">

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Higher electricity and water bills, maybe someday</h3>
          <p>
            We prefer an aging grid held together with duct tape. Modern infrastructure threatens the comfort of rolling blackouts, surprise outages, and infrastructure failures we have adjusted to.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Property values might go up, which sounds scary</h3>
          <p>
            Rising property values could increase equity, attract reinvestment, and improve public services.
            Naturally, we oppose all of that. Decline is predictable. Growth is unfamiliar.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Health risks, theoretical and carefully curated</h3>
          <p>
            Although backup generators run rarely and under strict regulation, we prefer to imagine them operating all day in a permanent cloud of doom.
            Nearby highways, warehouses, delivery trucks, and existing industrial uses are familiar and therefore harmless by default.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Noise concerns</h3>
          <p>
            Quiet enclosed buildings with limited traffic are unacceptable.
            We strongly favor constant diesel truck traffic, backup beeping, and overnight loading docks. Those noises feel more authentic.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Light pollution</h3>
          <p>
            Security lighting that meets code and turns off when it is not needed feels suspicious.
            We prefer the warm glow of underfunded streetlights, broken fixtures, and dark corridors that discourage walking and safety.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">Additional concerns we are willing to consider</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>Concern: Too many engineers per capita.</li>
            <li>Concern: Threat of excessively polite town hall behavior.</li>
            <li>Concern: Children might grow up understanding how the power grid works.</li>
            <li>Concern: Someone might say data center instead of warehouse and ruin the mood.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h3 class="font-semibold">Our real concern, just being honest</h3>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm">
            <li>More jobs. Too stabilizing.</li>
            <li>More tax revenue. Unsettling.</li>
            <li>Better infrastructure. Suspicious.</li>
            <li>Planning for the AI economy. Sounds complicated.</li>
            <li>Anything new, especially if it works. Absolutely not.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="font-semibold">In summary</h3>
          <p>
            We are not anti data center.
            We are pro decline, pro status quo, and pro complaint.
            We will fight progress quietly, loudly, and most of all online.
