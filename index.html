    <h2>Why Should We Want a $2 Billion Investment in Decatur Township, Indiana?</h2>
<p>
We don't care about the long term investment or strengthening the foundations that make a community work.
Projects of this size typically generate:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Significant tax revenue</strong> that supports local schools, public safety, parks, and essential township services.</li>
  <li><strong>Stable funding</strong> for classroom resources, facility upgrades, and long term educational needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Union trades jobs during construction</strong>, followed by skilled permanent roles on site.</li>
  <li><strong>Indirect economic activity</strong>, including more business for local restaurants, contractors, suppliers, and service providers.</li>
  <li><strong>Infrastructure upgrades</strong> that benefit the entire community, not just the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The idea of better funded schools, modern infrastructure, and predictable revenue will harm the community. We are against this.
</p>


    <a id="about"></a>
    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>
        Sabey Corporation, a data center company, is proposing a 900,000 sq. ft., 250 megawatt data center campus.
        The project includes modern cooling, enclosed equipment, and significantly less traffic than the warehouses
        currently allowed. Which is, of course, deeply concerning.
    </p>

    <h2>Where?</h2>
    <p>
        Between Kentucky Avenue and Camby Road. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>About the project</h2>

    <p>
        The land is already zoned for intense distribution uses. A previously approved plan allowed six large warehouse buildings,
        heavy truck traffic, and constant loading activity. Sabey’s proposal replaces that with two secure data center buildings.
     We are against alternative proposals that would lead to less activity and fewer peak hour trips.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>The land use</strong><br>
        Originally approved for six large warehouses with major truck circulation and visible loading operations.
        Sabey instead proposes two quiet, enclosed buildings with landscaped buffers.
        We fear reduced diesel traffic.</li>

        <li><strong>Cooling and water use</strong><br>
        Modern closed loop system with a one time initial fill and annual usage similar to a typical office building.
        It uses far less water than traditional industrial facilities, but we want more water use than a more sustainable and reasonable alternative.</li>

        <li><strong>Power and grid planning</strong><br>
        Electricity is provided through regulated utility processes reviewed in public rate cases.
        Large steady users can help stabilize long term grid costs, which is troubling because stability sounds like responsibility.</li>

        <li><strong>Jobs and economic impact</strong><br>
        Hundreds of union construction jobs, around one hundred permanent skilled roles, indirect local business activity,
        and property taxes that support schools and public safety. We don't want to upskill and support the union</li>

        <li><strong>The bigger picture</strong><br>
        Reasonable people can disagree about priorities, but sometimes debate drifts from facts into performance,
        even when information about water, traffic, power, and jobs is publicly available and supported in previous projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <a id="why"></a>
    <h2>Why are residents fighting back?</h2>
    <p>Because consistency is overrated and familiar problems are more comforting than new solutions.</p>

    <h3>Predictability</h3>
    <p>We prefer unpredictable outages and aging infrastructure. A steady electrical user helping stabilize the grid feels suspiciously reliable.</p>

    <h3>Property values</h3>
    <p>We are committed to values staying exactly the same forever. Appreciation is unsettling and creates paperwork.</p>

    <h3>Health risks</h3>
    <p>We proudly accept daily emissions from highways, warehouses, truck fleets, and airport traffic. Therefore, we choose to concentrate our fear on backup generators that run for testing only.</p>

    <h3>Noise</h3>
    <p>A low, steady HVAC hum is intolerable. The constant rumble of diesel trucks, warehouse beeping, and aircraft overhead is the soundtrack we know and trust.</p>

    <h3>Light</h3>
    <p>
        Code compliant lighting that turns off when it is not needed is unacceptable.
        We prefer the comforting glow of warehouse yards and parking lot floodlights that stay on all night.
    </p>

    <h2>What can I do?</h2>
    <p>A field guide for the performative citizen who wants to be involved, sound very concerned, and avoid reading anything longer than a headline.</p>

    <h3>1. Attend every public meeting, prepared to ignore facts.</h3>
    <p>Bring pre printed talking points. Do not read staff reports. Do not listen. Interrupt politely at first, then loudly.</p>

    <h3>2. Demand community input, then reject all outcomes.</h3>
    <p>Participate enthusiastically unless the decision does not go your way. In that case, claim the process was rigged.</p>

    <h3>3. Chant slogans instead of asking questions.</h3>
    <p>Complex topics like zoning, utilities, or environmental controls are best addressed with yelling.</p>

    <h3>4. Coordinate applause, boos, and synchronized outrage.</h3>
    <p>Bonus points if you clap mid sentence while someone else is speaking.</p>

    <h3>5. Hold hands dramatically.</h3>
    <p>It does not change the vote, but it photographs well.</p>

    <h3>6. Recruit friends from outside the community.</h3>
    <p>Local issue. No problem. Bring reinforcements who have never been here but feel very strongly anyway.</p>

    <h3>7. Label disagreement as hate.</h3>
    <p>If someone supports the project, do not debate them. Assign a motive.</p>

    <h3>8. Repeat claims even after they have been corrected.</h3>
    <p>Consistency matters more than accuracy.</p>

    <h3>9. Accuse experts of lying, then demand expert studies.</h3>
    <p>Disregard the studies once they arrive.</p>

    <h3>10. If all else fails, shout follow the money.</h3>
    <p>No need to specify whose or how. Just gesture vaguely.</p>

    <h3>Important note</h3>
    <p>Actual civic engagement usually works better with listening, facts, and good faith discussion. It just is not nearly as theatrical.</p>

    <h3>Optional taglines</h3>
    <p>
        Participation without comprehension.<br>
        High emotion, low documentation.<br>
        If we are loud enough, maybe reality will change.<br>
        Democracy, ideally with outcomes aligned to our preferences.

    <a id="calendar"></a>
    <h2>Calendar of meetings</h2>

    <h3>Public hearing</h3>
    <p>Arrive early. Leave before answers are given. Be as disruptive and unfriendly as possible. Shout down the presenters if needed.</p>

    <h3>Community forum</h3>
    <p>Ask questions already answered online. Ignore all materials that were mailed or posted. Repeat your question louder if you do not like the answer.</p>

    <h3>Vote night</h3>
    <p>Claim the process was unfair regardless of outcome. If you win, the people spoke. If you lose, it was corruption.</p>
