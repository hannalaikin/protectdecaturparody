    <a id="about"></a>
    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>
        Sabey Corporation, a data center company, is proposing a 900,000 sq. ft., 250 megawatt data center campus.
        The project includes modern cooling, enclosed equipment, and significantly less traffic than the warehouses
        currently allowed. Which is, of course, deeply concerning.
    </p>

    <h2>Where?</h2>
    <p>
        Between Kentucky Avenue and Camby Road. <br>
        <em>(Image sourced from Sabey’s publicly available project materials.)</em>
    </p>

    <a id="why"></a>
    <h2>Why are residents fighting back?</h2>
    <p>Because consistency is overrated and familiar problems are more comforting than new solutions.</p>

    <h3>Predictability</h3>
    <p>We prefer unpredictable outages and aging infrastructure. A steady electrical user helping stabilize the grid feels suspiciously reliable.</p>

    <h3>Property values</h3>
    <p>We are committed to values staying exactly the same forever. Appreciation is unsettling and creates paperwork.</p>

    <h3>Health risks</h3>
    <p>We proudly accept daily emissions from highways, warehouses, truck fleets, and airport traffic. Therefore, we choose to concentrate our fear on backup generators that run for testing only.</p>

    <h3>Noise</h3>
    <p>A low, steady HVAC hum is intolerable. The constant rumble of diesel trucks, warehouse beeping, and aircraft overhead is the soundtrack we know and trust.</p>

    <h3>Light</h3>
    <p>
        Code compliant lighting that turns off when not needed is unacceptable.
        We prefer the comforting glow of warehouse yards and parking lot floodlights that stay on all night.
    </p>

    <p>
        Read more about the “impacts” of data centers on our About page and on the Citizens Action Coalition website,
        where we select only the facts that support our concerns.

    <h2>What can I do?</h2>
    <p>A field guide for the performative citizen who wants to be involved, sound very concerned, and avoid reading anything longer than a headline.</p>

    <h3>1. Attend every public meeting, prepared to ignore facts.</h3>
    <p>Bring pre printed talking points. Do not read staff reports. Do not listen. Interrupt politely at first, then loudly.</p>

    <h3>2. Demand community input, then reject all outcomes.</h3>
    <p>Participate enthusiastically unless the decision does not go your way. In that case, claim the process was rigged.</p>

    <h3>3. Chant slogans instead of asking questions.</h3>
    <p>Complex topics like zoning, utilities, or environmental controls are best addressed with yelling.</p>

    <h3>4. Coordinate applause, boos, and synchronized outrage.</h3>
    <p>Bonus points if you clap mid sentence while someone else is speaking.</p>

    <h3>5. Hold hands dramatically.</h3>
    <p>It does not change the vote, but it photographs well.</p>

    <h3>6. Recruit friends from outside the community.</h3>
    <p>Local issue. No problem. Bring reinforcements who have never been here but feel very strongly anyway.</p>

    <h3>7. Label disagreement as hate.</h3>
    <p>If someone supports the project, do not debate them. Assign a motive.</p>

    <h3>8. Repeat claims even after they have been corrected.</h3>
    <p>Consistency matters more than accuracy.</p>

    <h3>9. Accuse experts of lying, then demand expert studies.</h3>
    <p>Disregard the studies once they arrive.</p>

    <h3>10. If all else fails, shout follow the money.</h3>
    <p>No need to specify whose or how. Just gesture vaguely.</p>

    <h3>Important note</h3>
    <p>Actual civic engagement usually works better with listening, facts, and good faith discussion. It just is not nearly as theatrical.</p>

    <a id="calendar"></a>
    <h2>Calendar of Meetings</h2>

    <h3>Public hearing</h3>
    <p>Arrive early. Leave before answers are given. Be as disruptive and unfriendly as possible.</p>

    <h3>Community forum</h3>
    <p>Ask questions already answered online. Ignore all materials that were mailed or posted.</p>

    <h3>Vote night</h3>
    <p>Claim the process was unfair regardless of outcome. If you win, the people spoke. If you lose, it was corruption.</p>
