    <!-- SECTION: WHAT IS HAPPENING -->
    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What is happening</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Sabey Corporation plans to build a nine hundred thousand square foot data center campus between Kentucky Avenue and Camby Road. The project would use two hundred fifty megawatts of electric power which is a popular number for people to repeat when they want to sound informed.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        The size is large and the number is round which helps it travel well in group texts.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION: WHAT IS A DATA CENTER -->
    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What is a data center</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        A data center is a secure windowless building filled with computers. It is not designed for guests tours or retail shopping so people often find this suspicious.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        These computers store and manage information for everything from email to streaming to weather alerts. In short they make modern life work which can create discomfort because they are not very visible until someone proposes one nearby.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Some call them warehouses of the cloud which sounds dramatic and helps set the tone for many discussions.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION: IMPACT -->
    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What will be the impact</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        There are many claims about the impact of data centers. Some are factual some are speculative and some are repeated often enough that they begin to sound like fact even when they are not reviewed.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Utility costs</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        One concern is that the project will cause utility bills to skyrocket across Indiana. This assumes every infrastructure upgrade in the state occurs solely to serve one project and that no other economic development has ever used power before. It is a simple narrative and simple narratives are easy to share.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Pollution and health</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Another concern is that backup generators create constant pollution. In reality they are used only for testing and emergencies but imagining them running nonstop creates a more powerful emotional response. It also helps people ignore the air quality impacts from sources that already exist like highways warehouses and everyday traffic.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Water use</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Data centers use water for cooling. So do power plants golf courses and many industrial facilities. The difference is that water use from data centers is new to some people so it feels more threatening even when actual usage numbers vary by design and technology.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">Noise</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        These projects generally operate within required decibel limits but noise remains a compelling concern because everyone understands noise. Saying sixty five decibels also sounds technical which helps give arguments an authoritative feel.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION: WHAT IS SABEY -->
    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What is Sabey Corporation</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Sabey Corporation is a developer that builds data centers for companies that need significant computing capacity. Their clients include large well known technology firms which makes them an easier target for criticism because people often react more strongly to brands than to zoning maps.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        These facilities do not require many on site employees which surprises people and leads to claims that data centers create no jobs. The reality is that they create fewer jobs than a research park but more jobs than an empty field and fewer headaches than a heavy industrial use.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION: JOBS -->
    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Will Sabey generate jobs</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Sabey estimates around one hundred direct jobs for their campus. This is often compared to early projections for a research and development park that was never built. Using the highest job estimate from the unbuilt project helps strengthen arguments but does not reflect what actually exists on the land today.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Indirect jobs also occur through construction suppliers maintenance and other services though exact numbers depend on actual economic activity rather than slogans.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION: AI -->
    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What does this have to do with AI</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Artificial intelligence requires significant computing power which requires data centers. Many companies invest in AI because they believe it will improve their products or operations. Others invest because they fear falling behind competitors. The conversation sounds more ominous when framed as unstoppable forces reshaping daily life.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        The important part for local discussion is that AI workloads increase demand for data infrastructure which makes these facilities more common across the country.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION: SABEY POSITIVE INFO -->
    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why does Sabey have positive information on their website</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Companies present themselves in the best light possible. This is true for Sabey and it is true for opponents who highlight only negative possibilities. Most public debates involve both optimism and pessimism which means the truth usually sits quietly in the middle.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Many online summaries about data centers including AI generated text simplify issues and remove context which is why reviewing primary documents remains the best practice even if it is rarely the most popular.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION: WHAT CAN I DO TO FIGHT BACK -->
    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What can I do to fight back</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Opposition groups suggest attending meetings signing petitions emailing planners and displaying yard signs. These actions help demonstrate community engagement but they also create feedback loops where the same talking points circulate without new information.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-slate-800 space-y-1">
        <li>Attend meetings and participate respectfully though many prefer to arrive upset and leave early.</li>
        <li>Sign petitions which signal concern even if the reasons vary widely.</li>
        <li>Email planners which can be helpful though templates often repeat misunderstandings.</li>
        <li>Display yard signs which create visual solidarity and also create interesting conversations with neighbors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Checking meeting dates on multiple sources is wise because schedules change and rumors often travel faster than official updates.
      </p>

    <!-- SECTION: MORE RESOURCES -->
    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">More resources</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Below are articles and videos often shared in discussions. They are listed here as plain text and not as links.

    <section class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Behind the curtain</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        Discussions sometimes include references to financial firms utilities and political players. These dynamics can be complex. They also make strong material for dramatic storytelling which is why they appear frequently in public comments.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-800">
        People often express worry about large investment companies especially when they do not fully understand how utility regulation works. These concerns are understandable but often simplified into narratives that emphasize fear rather than policy.
