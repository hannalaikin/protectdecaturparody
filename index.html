        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-800">
          Sabey Corporation is a data center developer planning a campus of about nine hundred thousand square feet with power service of two hundred fifty megawatts. The figures sound dramatic in a sentence which is why they are repeated often.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Where</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-800">
          The campus is proposed between Kentucky Avenue and Camby Road in Decatur Township. For many people the space has lived as open land and flexible imagination. Any specific project will feel like too much for someone.
        </p>

      <!-- WHY -->
      <section class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why are residents fighting back</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-800">
          Because progress is inconvenient.

        <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-800 text-sm leading-relaxed">

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Bills might rise</h3>
            <p>
              It is often said that electricity and water bills will rise because of this project. Bills rise for many reasons yet it is satisfying to point to one visible site and declare it the main character in every future rate case.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Property value fears</h3>
            <p>
              Some stories warn that values will fall. Others point out that long term investment and modern infrastructure can support stability and improvement. In public meetings the line that feels more urgent usually wins the microphone.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Health stories and backup generators</h3>
            <p>
              Backup generators are described with lists of chemicals and the word etc. The etc does much of the work. Actual operating limits and test schedules are less exciting than the idea of engines running all night in a permanent cloud.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Noise</h3>
            <p>
              Concerns focus on equipment that may be heard at about the level of a passing car. Existing traffic roads and industrial activity that already live at that level fade into the background. New sound feels different even when measured the same.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3 class="font-semibold">Light</h3>
            <p>
              Any new lights can be described as a threat to sleep even when designs use full cutoff fixtures and controls. Familiar lights from parking lots billboards and vehicles are framed as part of the natural landscape.

          A guide for being very involved very loud and not especially informed.
        </p>

        <ol class="space-y-3 text-sm text-slate-800 leading-relaxed">

          <li>
            <strong>Attend public meetings and ignore facts.</strong><br>
            Bring printed talking points. Skip staff reports. Treat each presentation as an interruption to your speech.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Ask for community input then reject results.</strong><br>
            Participate fully. If the final decision differs from your preference declare that the process never counted.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Use slogans instead of questions.</strong><br>
            Detailed questions invite detailed answers. Short phrases fit better on signs and in short videos.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Coordinate applause and boos.</strong><br>
            Clap when someone repeats a rumor you like. Boo when someone quotes a study. Months of analysis can be reduced to a sound effect.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Use dramatic poses.</strong><br>
            Hold hands. Look upward. The vote count stays the same yet the photos look important.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Invite friends from other places.</strong><br>
            Ask people with strong feelings and limited context to attend. Local details can be added later or not at all.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Call disagreement hate.</strong><br>
            If someone supports the project assume they are against the community. Motives are faster than explanations.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Repeat claims after they are corrected.</strong><br>
            If a line is easy to remember and share it deserves another round even if slides at the meeting gave different information.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Accuse experts of lying while asking for more experts.</strong><br>
            Dismiss the first report as biased. Request another one. Explain that you already know how it will be slanted.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Use the phrase follow the money.</strong><br>
            Point in a general direction. Do not specify who how or where. Let imagination do the rest.

            Real civic work usually looks like reading long documents asking patient questions and listening to people who disagree. It does not fill group chats with clips which is part of why it happens quietly.

      <!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
      <section id="about" class="space-y-4">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">About the project</h2>

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          The original site describes the project with strong language about bills pollution water and noise. This section keeps the topics and adjusts the tone.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4">What is a data center</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          A data center is a secure building full of servers that keep digital services running. Because the buildings are quiet and closed to visitors it is easy to describe them as giant windowless warehouses and let imagination do the rest.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-5">Bills and the word skyrocket</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          Many paragraphs claim that bills will sky rocket. The idea that one campus can carry all blame for future rate changes is simple and satisfying. It also avoids talking about aging lines storms fuel prices and other decisions that shape a bill.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-5">Pollution and health framing</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          The project is linked to long chains of concern that include new power plants coal ash climate and regional air quality. Some of these topics are serious and deserve careful treatment. They can also be used as a list where every concern is attached to whichever project is being discussed that evening.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-5">Water use</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          Common talking points say that a data center can use between one and five million gallons of water per day which covers almost every design imaginable. Designs that use air cooling or closed loop systems are often mentioned briefly or not at all because they complicate the headline.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-5">Noise and decibels</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          Noise is described with figures like sixty five decibels late at night. That level is roughly similar to traffic yet existing roads are treated as background while new equipment is treated as crisis. The number stays the same but the story around it changes.
        </p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold mt-5">Jobs and expectations</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-800">
          The project is often compared to a research park that was once imagined for the site. The comparison is between a real proposal and a drawing that exists mainly in memory which is always a comfortable matchup for the drawing.
